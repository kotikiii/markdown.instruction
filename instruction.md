# Instruction for working with MarkDown

## Emphasising text

To bold text, add two asterisks (**) or underscores (__) before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters. For example, **like this** or __like that__

To italicize text, add one asterisk(*) or underscore(_) before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters. For example: *cat says meow* or _cat likes fish_

Alternatives for asterisk(*) exist for the cases where both bold and italic emphasises are needed. For example, *__cats are the cutest creatures__* (both styles are used)

## Lists
To add unordered list, use astersike(*)

## Working with images

To add an image, you need to write this formula:

 ![alternative text in case of error](path to image itself)

For example:

![that's my cat](1cat.jpeg)
